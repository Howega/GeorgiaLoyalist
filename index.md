    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      This project investigates Georgia during the American Revolution.
      While most historical treatments of Loyalism have focused on New York or the Carolinas, Georgia has often been overlookedâ€”despite being the
      only colony successfully reclaimed by British forces after the outbreak of war. This digital project reconstructs the locations, loss of property, and
      motivations of Georgia's Loyalists by mapping key individuals and commercial trade networks.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why It Matters</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      This project challenges traditional narratives of American unity by recovering the voices and choices of those who remained loyal to the British Crown. 
      Through visualization and the mapping of commercial and cultural ties, it sheds light on the civil conflict that defined the Revolution in Georgia and helps contextualize 
      the broader complexities of allegiance in the American South.
