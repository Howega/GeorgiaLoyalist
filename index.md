    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      This project investigates Georgia during the American Revolution.
      While most historical treatments of Loyalism have focused on New York or the Carolinas, Georgia has often been overlookedâ€”despite being the
      only colony successfully reclaimed by British forces after the outbreak of war. This digital project reconstructs the locations, loss of property, and
      motivations of Georgia's by mapping key individuals and commerical trade networks from archival sources.

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      This project challenges traditional narratives of American unity by recovering the voices and choices of those who remained loyal to the British Crown. 
      Through visualization and archival research, it sheds light on the civil conflict that defined the Revolution in Georgia and helps contextualize 
      the broader complexities of allegiance in the American South.
