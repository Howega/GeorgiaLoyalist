I’m Garrett Howe, a graduate student in American history at Boston College, specializing in the Revolutionary era and Atlantic studies. Originally from the Southeast, I focus on Georgia’s often-overlooked role in the American Revolution—particularly the lives and loyalties of those who remained loyal to the Crown.

### Origins of the Project

This project emerged from earlier research into colonial Georgia and the region’s commercial trade networks. While working with Loyalist Claims—petitions submitted by exiled Americans after the war seeking compensation—I was struck by the sheer volume and richness of detail in the letters. I chose to focus on claims that included detailed property inventories, many of which shed light on the economic and personal stakes Loyalists faced.

### Methodological Choices

A few key decisions shaped the direction of this project:

- **Scope**: Due to the size of the Loyalist Claims archive, I focused primarily on claims made by Georgians with the most detailed accounts of property loss.
- **Representation**: This inevitably skewed the sample toward wealthier Loyalists—planters and merchants—leaving out poorer whites, African Americans, and Native Americans, all of whom made up a significant portion of Loyalist support in the South.
- **Mobility**: I discovered that many claimants had moved frequently during the war. Savannah, after its capture by the British, became a safe haven for persecuted Loyalists across the South, further complicating the geographic focus.
- **Currency**: I translated British pound values from the 1780s into 2025 U.S. dollars to help modern readers grasp the economic impact of these losses.

### Purpose and Goals

These visualizations are designed as educational tools—resources that invite further questions about Georgia’s path toward revolution and the broader meanings of Loyalism. This project is not exhaustive; rather, it offers a foundation for continued exploration of the Loyalist Claims and the contested loyalties of Revolutionary-era Georgia.
